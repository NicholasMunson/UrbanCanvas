# Urban Canvas Client

Urban Canvas is a web app that allows users to document local outdoor art installations, and view all art installations to find local art near you.

---

This is a React app for Urban Canvas' frontend. It talks to an Express server that can be found [here](https://github.com/Pleeper228/urban-canvas-server) and the deployed link can be found [here](https://urban-canvas-client.herokuapp.com).

---

To install locally make sure the the API server is running and that cors and fetch request urls have been updated to match your local environment then just:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The app is now available!
